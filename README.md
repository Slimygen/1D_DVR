# 1D_DVR
1 dimensional dvr code

Steps to use this code:
	-Define any 1 dimensional potential you like in the function v(x)
	-Define the grid by changing step, start, and stop
	-Define the mass of the particle you are simulating (1 if you are simulating an electron. This code uses atomic units)
	-Define how many orbitals you want to visualize with the variable num_graph
	-Run the python code!
