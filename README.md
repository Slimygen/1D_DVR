# 1D_DVR
1 dimensional dvr code

Steps to use this code:
	(1) Define any 1 dimensional potential you like in the function v(x).
	(2) Define the grid by changing step, start, and stop.
	(3) Define the mass of the particle you are simulating (1 if you are simulating an electron. This code uses atomic units).
	(5) Define how many orbitals you want to visualize with the variable num_graph.
	(6) Run the python code!
